Alex Vargas requested a page redesign to his previous html and php website. Using react and styled components the site was reborn into this newer version with better graphics and load times.
Simple design for ease of access for users and mobile first styling. Designed a carousel for the hero and reusable tile cards for the issues and endorsements. Image optimization is also done to reduce load of the website.
