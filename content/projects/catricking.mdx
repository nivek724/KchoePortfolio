Catricking will be migrating from its current build your own website page to a custom domain hosted site using NextJs, Tailwind, and Supabase. The goal is to make a wikipedia styled website that looks more modern and news like. It will host youtube videos and be a place of learning for the community.
Expected launch time is beginning of next year 2024. The website will be built with no templates and all custom designed to make the page stand out from the rest and create a permanent place for tricking community to share information and have a record of history.
