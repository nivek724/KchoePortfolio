Paladin App was designed to allow users to swap tokens to pal and deposit pal to recieve hpal. The exchange would also have rewards for depositing and holding their token with paladin. The application used web 3 api's to communicate with the wallet api and the smart contract api.
I would regularly check tickets for user issues regarding missing rewards and other potential errors that would occur due to web 3 block chain issues. I helped revamp the page to run smoother and also redid code to improve redability mainly with css styles.
The site was being redesigned and I was assisting in that process as a consulting dev.
