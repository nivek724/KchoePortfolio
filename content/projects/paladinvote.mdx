Paladin Vote is the landing page that hosts access to all the resources for the community and is designed for ease of access for all platforms and devices. I provided some updates to the page primarily doing maintance however I did add the about page and restructured the warden tab for the site.
The biggest change made for this page was reducing the package load on build time to reduce the time required from 700 seconds to 200 seconds. Paladin vote required weekly changes to information and images requiring knowledge of the full stack and issues with the server.
