Not For Public Use.

Paladin Design is yet to be utilized publicly but is intended to launch with Paladin's next product release. It is a library for components that can be reused in multiple instances based on Paladin's styled design.
This used storybook as its way to display components and give individual feedback and response to different styled changes that could be done with each component. The methodology was to handle everything inside the component to only take in the necessary props and change its design based on what was given.
Each component would showcase versatility and consistency with multiple usecases and easy to use prop types. Expected to be utilized in future paladin projects.
