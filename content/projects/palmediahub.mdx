Paladin Keep is a site designed for the Paladin to update their followers in the crypto space on new releases and updates on plans for the year. It also serves as a place to educate newer followers to how their tech works and what it is used for.
Keep leverages NextJs, Mui, and Netlify Cms to load all the pages from the database and display it for the user quickly and smoothly. Utilizes a lazy loader for images to help smooth user load times and provide greater accisibility for drops in internet connection.
I was one of two primary developers on this projects and complete the majority of it from start to finish with designs off of a figma page to help stylize the site.
