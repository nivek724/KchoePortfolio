Not For Public Use.

Paladin metrics is a metrics system that was used by the team to calculate the metrics of vote incentives and to graph the returns from different incentive amounts among pools in curve's ecosystem.
Used React Charts.js and Mui to display information and forms which read data from rest apis of voting platforms such as curve. Handled millions of data points and translated calculations into labeled and structured graphs for the teams use.
Had a calculator function that would allow users to see expected return rates for vote incentives to offer x amount to reach x amount of graph percentage. This would enable our team to help clients better use our vote incentives platform for increasing their returns on curve's drops.
